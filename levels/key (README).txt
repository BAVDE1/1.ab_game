NOTE: levels are free to be changed, but avoid touching the lobby, or at least not the level selectors in the lobby

Normal blocks:
# = normal block
* = fancy block
: = grey block (non-collide-able)
. = light grey block (non-collide-able)
- = platform (top half of a normal block, is the only thing that can stop a lift, other than another lift)

Interact-able blocks
| = level select (should never be changed or added to a level)
! = win-pad (only one per level)
= = lift (must be placed beneath a platform or another lift)
^ = switch
" = timer switch (only one per level)

Teleporters
Only 9 teleporters allowed in any one level
The 'base' of the teleporter is prefixed with a number (from 1 to 9 numerically)
The first 'point' of a teleporter is prefixed with every second letter in the alphabet starting with 'a'
The second 'point' of a teleporter is prefixed with every second letter in the alphabet starting with 'b'
EXAMPLE: The first teleporter in a level has a base prefixed with '1', the first point of that teleporter is prefixed with 'a', and the second with 'b'
            Adding a second teleporter will be '2, c, d', a third would be '3, e, f' and so on.

For formality, every block is 20px by 20px
